## Overview
Active Record is part of the **M (Model)** in the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. It is responsible for representing data and business logic. Active Record allows us to create and use Ruby objects whose attributes are stored persistently in a database.

### Difference Between Active Record and Active Model
- **Active Record**: Used for modeling data with Ruby objects that require database storage.
- **Active Model**: Used for modeling data with Ruby objects that do not require database storage.
- Both Active Record and Active Model are part of the Model layer in MVC.
- Plain Ruby objects can also be used as models in Rails without Active Record.

### Active Record as a Pattern
- "Active Record" is also a **software architecture pattern**.
- Railsâ€™ Active Record is an **implementation** of this pattern.
- It is a type of **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** system.

## 1.1 The Active Record Pattern
> Martin Fowler describes the Active Record pattern in *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture* as:
>
> *"An object that wraps a row in a database table, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic to that data."*

- Active Record objects contain both **data** and **behavior**.
- The structure of Active Record classes closely matches database tables.
- This makes it easy to read and write data to the database using Ruby objects.

## 1.2 Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
- **ORM** connects objects in a programming language (like Ruby) to relational database tables.
- In Rails, **Active Record** serves as the ORM system.
- ORMs minimize the need to write raw SQL queries by mapping database tables to Ruby objects.
- Using an ORM, we can:
  - Store object attributes in the database.
  - Retrieve data without direct SQL queries.
  - Define relationships between objects easily.


## 1.3 Active Record as an ORM Framework
Active Record provides the following capabilities using Ruby objects:

- **Represent models and their data**.
- **Define associations** between models (e.g., `belongs_to`, `has_many`).
- **Implement inheritance hierarchies** in models.
- **Validate data** before persisting it in the database.
- **Perform database operations** in an object-oriented manner.
